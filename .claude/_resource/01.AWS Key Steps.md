  I'll guide you through the AWS Console:

  1. Go to IAM Console

  Open this link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/

  2. Create a New IAM User for Terraform

  Steps:
  1. Click Users in the left sidebar
  2. Click Create user
  3. Username: terraform-lambda-deploy
  4. Click Next

  3. Attach Permissions

  Select Attach policies directly and search for these policies:
  - ✅ AWSLambda_FullAccess
  - ✅ IAMFullAccess
  - ✅ CloudWatchLogsFullAccess

  Click Next → Create user

  4. Create Access Keys

  1. Click on your new user (terraform-lambda-deploy)
  2. Go to Security credentials tab
  3. Scroll to Access keys section
  4. Click Create access key
  5. Choose Command Line Interface (CLI)
  6. Check the confirmation checkbox
  7. Click Next → Create access key

  5. Copy Your Credentials

  ⚠️ CRITICAL: Save these NOW (they won't be shown again!)

  You'll see:
  Access key ID: AKIA...
  Secret access key: wJal...

  Download the CSV file or copy both values.

  Once You Have the Credentials

  Let me know when you have them, and I'll help you:

  1. Set them up securely as environment variables
  2. Test the connection to AWS
  3. Run terraform plan to preview the infrastructure
  4. Deploy your Lambda function

  Do you want to proceed with creating the IAM user now, or do you already have existing credentials you'd like to use?
