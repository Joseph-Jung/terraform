I need a terraform project to build an AWS lambda funciton to be deployed via Azure pipeline. The lambda function does return value "Hello World" as a service. 

# Technical details
** Lambda Runtime**: Node.js 18.x
** Project path: v2
** Support github and respository: https://github.com/Joseph-Jung/terraform

I want a plan document to perform the requirement above under the .claude/plan folder.
